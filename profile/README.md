# Christine & Co.'s Projects

This organisation is for projects by [Christine Rizkallah](https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/rizkallahc/)'s students and RAs.

You can look at each other's repositories for inspiration and LaTeX templates.

## TODOs

* Please try to keep one repository per overarching project.
* Please write an informative description for your repo, including your name, what you're working on, and the years your project is supposed to run for.

## FAQ

- Q: Why do so many repositories start with `summaries`?
- A: The organisation was set up through Github Classrooms. Github Classrooms allows easy ways to mass create repos for things like assignments, and I think every user gets a default "summaries" repository by default. You do not have to (and are encoraged not to) interact with Github Classrooms to use this organisation.

- Q: Why is the organisation named `honours-theses`?
- A: The organisation was originally set up to manage Christine's honours student's projects. It has since expanded in scope to include repositories for all of Christine's student's projects. It should, for accuracy's sake, be renamed to `crizkallah-students` or something like that (or our group name, if we actually had a research group name), but that would break everyone's bookmarks and git remotes, so `honours-theses` it remains.
